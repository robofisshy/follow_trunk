###Debug notes

###date 2016.8.15
	Use raspberry pi to control the motors.
	Porting openNI to pi.
	Write driver to drive motors.
	Optimize program by add "-O2" during compiling. 
###date 2016.8.16
	Debugging,we found the motor have some problem of mechanical structure,
	maybe there arm some differences between the two motors,like resistance...etc.
###date 2016.8.27
	We bought a little car to test our code.
	Modify my code to generate PWM to control motors.
###date 2016.9.9
   	When we testing the car,we found it can not work well in the dark environment,
	we measured some paramaters, found the battery has run down.
	Increase the duty ratio of PWM to increase the velocity.
